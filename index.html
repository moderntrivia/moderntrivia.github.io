<p>There was a new mayor and I had a flight on Spirit Airlines booked
for Fort Lauderdale that afternoon. I wasn’t trying to escape the city
for political reasons, at least the original motivation didn’t feel that
way at the time I booked the flight, although it kind of feels like I
might’ve been, now. I bought a ticket to a Doug Stanhope stand-up show
over the summer. Here’s some timeless wisdom: don’t bet against the
candidate you just voted for if you aren’t prepared to feel a little
conflicted. Betting against your team isn’t just a win-win idea, it’s
also a lose-lose idea. If you want to keep the integrity of your moral
intuition completely intact, betting against your own team is a bad
idea.</p>
<p>Anyway, I logged into Spirit’s website to check-in for my flight that
morning and was hit with a screen offering me credit to give up my
reservation since apparently the flight was full. That’s not surprising,
I guess, but it got me thinking about what types of people might book a
last minute ticket on a budget flight to Florida the day after the
election of our new communist mayor. I wasn’t giving up my seat, I
already paid for my hotel room. It was going to be an interesting
day.</p>
<p>Man I felt sick on my way to the airport. And people seemed
especially rude, at least until I got to the airport, then I felt even
sicker but everyone at the gate was in the same boat, so-to-speak. This
was the captain’s last flight before retirement. Everyone cheered the
stewardess’ announcement. The guy next to me went to use the lavatory on
the ascent, a somewhat turbulent ascent, so I used the opportunity to
get up and go, too. I chugged the entire volume of my water bottle in
line for the TSA so I really needed to relieve myself. I went to the
front and the guy up there told me that seat belts should still be on I
said oh really like didn’t know. So I went back to my seat and had to
bother this woman again then waited for the guy who was next to me to
come back then went to the lavatory in the back. They announced that
they’d made a slight deviation in the flight plan, only to delay us by a
few minutes. Outside I noticed what looked to be another Spirit airliner
flying maybe 2000 feet down, back, and to the right of our plane. I
wonder if this had something to do with our captain’s last flight for
Spirit. The stewardess started to cry during her final announcement.
He’d been flying commercial aircraft as long as I’d been alive. I felt
like a bum. Everyone shook his hand on the way off the plane.</p>
<p>Trump is threatening to trap me in South Florida. This isn’t even
concerning, I find this hilarious.</p>
<p>President Trump and the FAA have ordered a reduction of flights at
forty airports, including Fort Lauderdale and Newark, by Saturday, the
day I’m scheduled to fly back to New York.</p>
<p><em>It’s not that I had to do it. I just wanted to test it.</em></p>
<p>I had the ridiculous idea of taking an Uber all the way to Miami. How
far can you take an Uber? These ridiculous ideas come easy in this
state. Is that bad? I guess the answer comes when I’m standing on a
random corner in Miami, with no way to get to my flight (if there is
one).</p>
<p>Man, what a clusterfuck. I feel sick again this morning. I didn’t
feel that way when I woke up earlier but something broke inside me and
I’d rather write this when I felt well but I don’t know when that will
be.</p>
<p>Mistakes were made. I spent money more carelessly than I’d like to
have. There’s a little waitress named Miranda at the Lucky Fish bar and
grill on Dania Beach who I’d wished last night I’d have asked for her
number. Maybe I wouldn’t have stayed at this hostel (which is pretty
convenient for a single boy dealing with a cancelled flight except for
that it reminds me of jail).</p>
<p>They cancelled my flight twice. The previous morning I went to the
Lucky Fish for breakfast. I got a black coffee and plain bagel with
cream cheese. When I got there I didn’t want to go up because they
started blasting shitty country music at 8am but I didn’t really have
any other options so I went up and the girl was there so I went up and
isn’t this starting to read like a Hemmingway novel? Well she was cute
and I was sick and in the bathroom after I’d decided I wasn’t going to
ask her like I planned I got an email saying my flight was canceled. So
I left the place, smoked a cigarette on a picnic table. Some guy was
driving his car the wrong way on the one-way and some other guy changing
in the parking lot said <em>wrong way, idiot.</em> I’ve done the same
thing numerous times but I said, <em>Can you believe these tourists man?
Learn how to read a sign, fucking IDIOT! If I had a nickel.</em> The fat
fuck in the parking lot was silent and crossed the street to the beach
without looking back. I flicked my cigarette into the trash and went
back up to the Lucky Fish to ask the girl for her name and number except
I never really committed to asking her for her number so I loudly, like
a baffoon, asked her for her name and immediately forgot it and started
rambling how my flight had been cancelled and said Maria? She said
Miranda and I said my name is Jacob (Jake?). This is my greatest
weakness. I try to see it as not a weakness because some few women in
the past have come onto me and the only thing I had to do was go with it
and over the years I’ve increasingly just decided not to go with it
because it’s just easier and just knowing I could have was satisfying
enough. But for me to actually try to make something happen, well I’m
starting to worry it’s not possible anymore so I was trying it on Amanda
and it wasn’t working well. That’s just not how it works. But there are
greater forces in the Universe, namely Spirit Airlines, that were
testing me and seemed to be giving me more attempts at something. I got
an Uber to the Motel 6 and the driver was from New York. I was whining
to him like why me and he’s like it’s not just you, man. I said I know
but the FAA has cancelled maybe 4% of the flights? He said 10%. I said
yeah it’s not a big deal. I went back to my room to call Spirit about
the cancelled flight and gather my shit and check out and booked another
flight later that night.</p>
<p>Hats off for all the federal workers who worked during the shut-down,
including TSA agents and especially air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon I went back to the beach and was intent on
asking Miranda for her number but after loitering around the restaurant
like a creep for a while I went up to use the bathroom, saw her
delivering food to a table, and walked down to the beach, took off my
sandals, and started walking toward Hollywood Beach. I really do love
long walks on the beach. I could walk for days. I got an overpriced
slice of “New York style” pizza which even using New York dollar slice
standards was terrible. It reminded me more of DiGiorno than anything
I’d ever witnessed in New York. It was like they just threw uncooked
toppings on an old cheese slice and put it in the microwave for 30
seconds. I gave them a review on Google (I never review anything) but
was sympathetic to the people working there including two girls and a
dude who looked like he could be my uncle and tear me apart and use me
for toppings on the next “prison style” pie he hawks to unsuspecting
tourists from Kentucky so I deleted the review. Now I wish I hadn’t.
I’ve met enough down-right monsters to not really be afraid of anyone
without a good reason but that’s not the point. These people seemed like
they could’ve been my family.</p>
<p>Anyway, they kept delaying my second flight later into the night. I
sat outside a touristy tee-shirt store charging my phone, brushed my
teeth using a public water fountain, just waiting to go to the airport
and get the fuck out of Florida and eventually I got another message
saying that my second flight had been canceled, too. I was going to
drink. I even went into a bar and almost ordered. The place was empty. I
wished I’d got Miranda’s number. Maybe I could’ve taken a shower. Spirit
rescheduled me for a twelve hour trip back to Newark with an eight hour
layover in Indianapolis scheduled to leave at 8:30pm, the next
night.</p>
<p>I got breakfast at McDonald’s and ordered an Uber to the Hollywood
Trirail station. The guy’s Uber smelled foul. I’m just saying was his
wife, but I won’t need to elaborate. I’m not sorry. I opened the window.
I wasn’t sure where I was going or even if I was going South toward
Miami or North toward the airport. I decided I’d buy a ticket that’d get
me to West Palm Beach (even though I think ChatGPT told me the night
before that weekend one-way tickets all cost $5 regardless of how far
you’re going).</p>
<p>Someone might feel betrayed if they discovered a place like Lake
Worth, Florida for the first time. There was this old abandoned house
there with a massive Banyan tree growing out of it. I looked around the
house years ago. The address is on the odd side of South M Street, just
north of 6th Avenue South. The house seemed to have been built in the
early 20th century. I was curious about the house, have always been
attracted back to it. I finally made it and it’s been levelled. But the
Banyan tree remained maybe more healthy than ever aside from a few
aerial roots that apparently needed to be cut as they must’ve grown into
and out of the house. This is fair. The tree deserved more protection
than the house did. According to some Facebook posts the tree was to be
preserved.</p>
<p><em>They can’t break me. They’re wasting their time.</em></p>
<p>I took the Trirail to the Fort Lauderdale Airport Station and then
the airport shuttle to Terminal 4. Just inside the door on the far side 
of the Spirit Airlines desk is an outlet where I waited for my flight
home from Puerto Rico last winter and watched that anime movie on
Netflix, <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em>, about the father trying to take 
care of his boy after fire bombings destroy their home and force them on 
the street to beg for food. Love that movie. Really lifts the spirits when
you start to wonder if you deserve anything, whatsoever.</p>
<p>We boarded the flight to Indianapolis and just by judging people’s
appearance, that seemed to be everyone’s final destination. A bunch of
Hoosiers on their way back from a drunken family vacation in beautiful,
exotic Hollywood, Florida. With overworked, unpaid air traffic
controllers, windy conditions on the way up, and wintry, windy
conditions expected on the way down, we took off. I spent my time
between sleep and trying to figure out if the corn-fed kid in the seat
in front of me was actually any good at sports betting or whether the
app he was using was even paying out real money. I don’t know what kind
of shitass sportsbooks you’re allowed to use in backwards nanny-states
like Florida or Indiana. (By the way, the roulette machine in the casino
in Dania Beach pays 2-to-1 on dozens. How the fuck are most forms of
gambling illegal and the few forms that are legal are completely,
unapologetically rigged?) The app the kid was using looked slick at
first, I don’t even think my oldass iPhone 12 would run it without
melting, but judging by the rocket ship moon animation thing that
indicated some sort of payout multiplier every two minutes (whatever the
fuck that is) it looked to be some kind of childproof, non-serious
betting platform I’d never seen before.</p>
<p>Before the descent the older woman in the window seat next to me
asked to get out so I nudged my brother to the left and got out, too. I
made a point to look as sketchy as possible, like I was on a mission to
plant a bomb, as the older woman went to the front lavatory and I made
my way to the back. Passing the people in the back I said ironically,
<em>well looks like they’re finally taking me out</em>. Anyone with half
a brain not plugged into an iPad might understand what I was implying.
After taking a piss and some drags off the vape, I started making my way
back to the front and passing my fellow midwesterners I said, <em>you
know what you all did</em>. The older woman and I got back to our row
perfectly at the same time, like we’re in cahoots, and as I let her get
comfortable I gave the back of the plane a little nod.</p>
